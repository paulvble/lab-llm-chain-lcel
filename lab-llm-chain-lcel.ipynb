That's where LangServe comes in.\n","LangServe helps developers deploy LangChain chains as a REST API. You do not need to use LangServe to use LangChain, but in this guide we'll show how you can deploy your app with LangServe.\n","\n","While the first part of this guide was intended to be run in a Jupyter Notebook or script, we will now move out of that. We will be creating a Python file and then interacting with it from the command line.\n","\n","Install with:\n","```bash\n","pip install \"langserve[all]\"\n","```\n","\n","### Server\n","\n","To create a server for our application we'll make a `serve.py` file. This will contain our logic for serving our application. It consists of three things:\n","1. The definition of our chain that we just built above\n","2. Our FastAPI app\n","3. A definition of a route from which to serve the chain, which is done with `langserve.add_routes`\n","\n","\n","```python\n","#!/usr/bin/env python\n","from typing import List\n","\n","from fastapi import FastAPI\n","from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate\n","from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser\n","from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI\n","from langserve import add_routes\n","\n","# 1. Create prompt template\n","system_template = \"Translate the following into {language}:\"\n","prompt_template = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n","    ('system', system_template),\n","    ('user', '{text}')\n","])\n","\n","# 2. Create model\n","model = ChatOpenAI()\n","\n","# 3. Create parser\n","parser = StrOutputParser()\n","\n","# 4. Create chain\n","chain = prompt_template | model | parser\n","\n","\n","# 4. App definition\n","app = FastAPI(\n","  title=\"LangChain Server\",\n","  version=\"1.0\",\n","  description=\"A simple API server using LangChain's Runnable interfaces\",\n",")\n","\n","# 5. Adding chain route\n","\n","add_routes(\n","    app,\n","    chain,\n","    path=\"/chain\",\n",")\n","\n","if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","    import uvicorn\n","\n","    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"localhost\", port=8000)\n","```\n","\n","And that's it! If we execute this file:\n","```bash\n","python serve.py\n","```\n","we should see our chain being served at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).\n","\n","### Playground\n","\n","Every LangServe service comes with a simple [built-in UI](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langserve/blob/main/README.md#playground) for configuring and invoking the application with streaming output and visibility into intermediate steps.\n","Head to [http://localhost:8000/chain/playground/](http://localhost:8000/chain/playground/) to try it out! Pass in the same inputs as before - `{\"language\": \"italian\", \"text\": \"hi\"}` - and it should respond same as before.\n","\n","### Client\n","\n","Now let's set up a client for programmatically interacting with our service. We can easily do this with the `[langserve.RemoteRunnable](/docs/langserve/#client)`.\n","Using this, we can interact with the served chain as if it were running client-side."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":16,"id":"85174643","metadata":{"id":"85174643","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":361},"executionInfo":{"status":"error","timestamp":1719904129079,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":426,"user":{"displayName":"Paul Le","userId":"03470187681807534252"}},"outputId":"30572379-f559-429d-90df-6798be1f6ba2"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"error","ename":"ModuleNotFoundError","evalue":"No module named 'langserve'","traceback":["\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m","\u001b[0;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m                       Traceback (most recent call last)","\u001b[0;32m<ipython-input-16-055206b70891>\u001b[0m in \u001b[0;36m<cell line: 1>\u001b[0;34m()\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0;32m----> 1\u001b[0;31m \u001b[0;32mfrom\u001b[0m \u001b[0mlangserve\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mimport\u001b[0m \u001b[0mRemoteRunnable\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[0m\u001b[1;32m      2\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      3\u001b[0m \u001b[0mremote_chain\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m=\u001b[0m \u001b[0mRemoteRunnable\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"http://localhost:8000/chain/\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1;32m      4\u001b[0m \u001b[0mremote_chain\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m.\u001b[0m\u001b[0minvoke\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m(\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m{\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\"language\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\"italian\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m,\u001b[0m \u001b[0;34m\"text\"\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m:\u001b[0m \u001b[0;32mNone\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m}\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m)\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0;34m\u001b[0m\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[0;31mModuleNotFoundError\u001b[0m: No module named 'langserve'","","\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0;32m\nNOTE: If your import is failing due to a missing package, you can\nmanually install dependencies using either !pip or !apt.\n\nTo view examples of installing some common dependencies, click the\n\"Open Examples\" button below.\n\u001b[0;31m---------------------------------------------------------------------------\u001b[0m\n"],"errorDetails":{"actions":[{"action":"open_url","actionText":"Open Examples","url":"/notebooks/snippets/importing_libraries.ipynb"}]}}],"source":["from langserve import RemoteRunnable\n","\n","remote_chain = RemoteRunnable(\"http://localhost:8000/chain/\")\n","remote_chain.invoke({\"language\": \"italian\", \"text\": None})"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"480b78a9","metadata":{"id":"480b78a9"},"source":["To learn more about the many other features of LangServe [head here](/docs/langserve)."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"befdb168","metadata":{"id":"befdb168"},"source":["## Conclusion\n","\n","That's it!
